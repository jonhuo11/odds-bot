# odds-bot
Play a stupid gambling game with your friends on [Discord](https://discord.com/).

This bot allows Discord users to create [moneyline](https://sportshandle.com/moneyline/) bets on arbitrary event outcomes. Users can create a new odds game, set the possible event outcomes and their moneyline percentages, and then other users can bet on outcomes.

# Run the bot
Environment variable `ODDSBOTTOKEN` must be set to the Discord bot user token. Use `go run .` from this directory to start the bot.
