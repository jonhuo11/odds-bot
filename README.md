# odds-bot
Play a stupid gambling game with your friends on Discord.

This bot allows Discord users to create "moneyline" bets on arbitrary event outcomes. Users can create a new odds game, set the possible event outcomes and their moneyline percentages, and then other users can bet on outcomes.

# Run the bot
Environment variable `ODDSBOTTOKEN` must be set to the bot user token. Use `go run .` from this directory to start the bot.
